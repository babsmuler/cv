  <p>My name is Emmanuel Alamou, a technical-minded Beninois national and an IT-trained professional who turned his hobby and love for languages into a full-time job. I can marshall my ananlytical mind, and translation skills to bear on the job at hand. I have so far dealt mainly in technical document translations with an emphasis on climate change.
    My education spanned Africa and Europe: my primary and secondary studies in Benin, my undergraduate at <a href="https://www.ug.edu.gh/">the Univeristy of Ghana, Legon</a> and my postgraduate in UK at <a href="https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/">the University of Liverpool</a>. My strong bilingualism hails from having studied and worked in both eduational and work environments: as an IT professional, I had the opportunities to work for Amnesty Intenational for 14 years as the technical support covering a great deal of the African continent, both Anglophone and Francophone countries. As such based in East Africa, Kampala, Uganda I used to tour the continent in its Western, Eastern and Southern parts. I had to interact professionally with <a href="https://www.amnesty.org">Amnesty International</a>'s members and staff, business people and to conduct training in countries such South Africa, Ghana, C√¥te d'Ivoire, Burkina Faso, Gambia, Tanzania, Togo, Zambia etc. That has sharpened my already great interest for both English and French and a bias for constantly switching my mind to the other language when hearing someone speaking in any of them.
